`stitch-order-element`
Configures an order from Amazon

<dom-module id="stitch-order-element">
	<template>
		<style>
			:host {
				display: block;

		<!--
		  Development guidelines:
			- Stick to paper elements if possible for UI widgets
			- The mockup shows the element enclosed inside a white page on an off-white background. No need to build that
			  in; it will be part of the environment in which the element is used.
			- This folder contains a mockup.png with a mockup of the approximate element we're looking for. Interpret it as
			  mostly a guide for what we'd like the layout to look like. We know paper-elements, for example, result in
			  a different visual style than shown there.

		  Error handling:
			- If a product search turns up no results, or more than one results, we'll need to hide the remainder of the form
			  and display an error.
			- When the URL bar is empty (and thus there are no results), we'll need to hide the form and display a message
			  saying to copy and paste an amazon product web page URL in there to create an order.

		  How to read the element below:
			- For the most part, design/develop is up to you. I scaffolded out a *few* bits below as a way to explain a few
			  particular architecture needs that we anticipate in order to integrate with our system.
			  e.g.: the different userOrder and userOrderForSave objects.
